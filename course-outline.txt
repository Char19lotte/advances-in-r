Advanced R Short Course
-----------------------------------------

Goals
This one-day course is set out to improve your R skills and make you a more efficient programmer. In particular, you will:
	- understand complex data types and how to work with them
	- understand what functional programming means
	- learn about metaprogramming
	- be able to identify performance bottlenecks and convert slow R functions to fast C++ equivalents
	- get better at reading other's R code
Among the packages we will cover are: tidyr, plyr, dplyr, data.table, stringr, formatR (http://yihui.name/formatR/)


broom
janitor
tidyr




Requirements
Working knowledge of R is a necessary prerequisite. You're assumed to be familiar with fundamentals such as how to operate with different object types in R, how to work with the apply family (apply(), sapply() etc.), and how to program your own basic functions. 

Are you prepared for taking this course? Take a look at the basic R vocabulary listed here: http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Vocabulary.html Are you aware of at least 60% to 80% of the functions? Then you're prepared. 

Segments to work on:

- 01-file-management ## DONE .75h
- 02-functions ## DONE 1.25h
- 03-functional-programming ## TO BE DESIGNED
- 04-string-processing ## DONE 1.5h
- 05-piping-with-magrittr ## DONE! .75h
- 06-tidying data ## COVER tidyr PACKAGE, DESIGN EXERCISE! 1.5h
- 07-manipulating-data-frames ## DONE 1h
- 08-split-apply-combine
- 09-debugging ## DESIGN EXERCISE! .75h


- data tidying with the tidyverse (tibble, readr, purrr, tidyr, janitor, tidytext: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/janitor/vignettes/introduction.html)
- parallel computing
- rcpp --> identify and remove performance bottlenecks
- clean up code: http://yihui.name/formatR/
- running R in the cloud: http://rpubs.com/chrisbail/intro_to_programming
- dive deeper into R: https://ironholds.org/projects/rbitrary/

DO a little survey in advance:
- familiarity with packages: dplyr, magrittr etc.
- about which of the following tasks would you like to learn more
- personal setup, R experience, experience with other statistical software
- which data do you usually work with: time series data, survey data, country-level data, text data, small-n data, large-n data

Use data packages:
install.packages(c("nycflights13", "gapminder", "Lahman"))

Resources
The course closely follows Hadley Wickhams "Advanced R" book. A free version of the book is available at http://adv-r.had.co.nz/; a physical copy can be purchased here: https://www.amazon.de/Advanced-Chapman-Hall-Hadley-Wickham/dp/1466586966
 
IMPORTANT:
There is a short required reading that helps us jump right in the middle of interesting stuff at the beginning of the course. To do so, please skim the chapter od "Foundations" (Data structures, Subsetting etc.) of "Advanced R" to make sure we've got roughly the same knowledge about foundations of R. This will take you approximately XX to XX hours, but it's worth the time.
